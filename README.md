# Employee Salary Prediction
 Beginner ML project to predict the salary of employees using a Linear Regression model and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

 ## Project Overview  
- Explored an HR dataset (`HumanResources.csv`).  
- Cleaned missing values.  
- Performed EDA with statistical summaries and visualizations (salary distribution, gender vs. salary, education vs. salary, etc.).  
- Encoded categorical variables with one-hot encoding.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict salary.  
- Evaluated performance with **MSE** and **RÂ²**.  
- Interpreted model coefficients to understand which factors influence salary.  

## Insights  
- Higher education levels contributes to higher salaries.  
- Job title and department are strong predictors of salary.  
- Performance rating had little influence on salary compared to other features.
